Since Hacker Spaces are about communication, we felt this was a good way of symbolizing what we do. You can also say that Syn, could stand for \"Synergy\". Synergy is defined as two or more things functioning together to produce a result not independently obtainable, which also fits well with the Hacker Space ideals. And lastly since we live in Las Vegas, SYN is a fun play on words and the city's often heard nick name \"Sin City.\"</p>"},{"location":"admins/","title":"rtfm administration","text":"<p>rtfm site is built with MkDocs.  </p> <p>For systems administration content that used to be in this section, please see google docs.</p>"},{"location":"admins/#content-changes","title":"Content changes","text":"<ul> <li>Fork the rtfm repo to your user on github</li> <li>Go to your copy of the repo (eg https://github/USERNAME/rtfm) and clone it</li> <li>if you haven't already, install mkdocs on your local machine.</li> <li>create a branch, make your edits</li> <li>run \"mkdocs build\" and verify that the changes look good locally.</li> <li>commit your changes them and push the branch up to your github rtfm repo</li> <li>create a pull request for your branch against master on the main rtfm repo</li> </ul> <p>A SYN Shop member will review and merge your request if it all looks good!</p>"},{"location":"admins/#how-content-is-pushed-live","title":"How content is pushed live","text":"<p>There are two repos to house content.

Since the board is hand etched we had to wire the vias. This created issues as our battery holders were right over the top of a few of them. Liberally applied tape kept everything from shorting out. We also had a tiny gap in one of the traces which was causing one of the 555 timers to not get the correct amount of power. This took a lot of time to track down. Both of these can be avoided if we have the boards made for us by a PCB manufacturer.</p> <p>Though this build had a lot of tricky stuff, most of it was related to cramming it into a tiny space. This is a really fun circuit to play with and can be easily built on a breadboard using dip components and a breakout board for the accelerometer.</p>"},{"location":"members/Projects/Shop/555%20Contest%20-%20Gravity%20Detecting%2C%20Color%20Swirling%20Pingpong%20Balls/#downloads","title":"Downloads","text":"<ul> <li>Schematic (Eagle)  | Full schematic for use with eagle</li> <li>Schematic (PDF)  | Same schematic, but in pdf form</li> <li>Board (Eagle)  | Board layout file for eagle</li> <li>Board Top (PDF)  | Board top in pdf format.

Some things to keep in mind: </p> <ul> <li>Double check your design between the program you started in, and RetinaEngrave.  The print driver is not smart, and cuts off sections if it resets to the standard letter size, can scale things when you need exact sizes, and most annoyingly renders solid lines into multiple ones at seemingly random.  The fist two are easy to fix, but the last will take a lot of trial and error to make lines thinner before printing to RetinaEngrave, or cleaning it up inside RE.</li> <li>It's good to follow the Laser Cutter checklist, but make note of your settings before you start, and be prepared to fix them all right before you start(press G).  A particular annoyance, the dropdown between Vector, Raster, or Raster then Vector.  It likes to reset that after doing a perimeter trace.</li> <li>Be prepared for experimentation on power vs speed.  Two passes at higher speed and lower power may cut better, take less time, and have less burn than one at lower speed and higher power.</li> </ul>","tags":["software"]},{"location":"members/Software/Retina%20Engrave/#double-sided-laser-engraving","title":"Double Sided Laser Engraving","text":"<p>Remember RetinaEngrave's lack of brain.

A 6mm one will be recognized</li> <li>Cut, then flip.  Trying to line up a board to engrave side A then engrave and cut side B is almost impossible to get level.  Instead, engrave and cut on side A, go steal a dental pick from the electronics bin, flip your object over in place, then engrave side B</li> <li>Blue painters tape or masking tape is your friend. Even if you don't need it to cover your surface to prevent burn, after you've engraved side B, sticking a strip of tap across your cutout parts and the board/plastic will let you pick up most, if not all, the pieces at once off the bed.</li> </ul>","tags":["software"]},{"location":"members/Software/Retina%20Engrave/#working-with-adobe-illustrator-and-retinaengrave","title":"Working with Adobe Illustrator and RetinaEngrave","text":"<p>Adobe Illustrator is a fairly common vector art tool, but its not available at SynShop.  The computer hooked up to the laser cutter has both CorelDraw and Inkscape on it if you are familiar with either, though as an Illustrator user I found both to be lacking in features I needed and confusing.  Both of those programs seem to print reasonably well into RetinaEngrave via the Full Spectrum driver, but AI seems to have issues.</p> <p>Helpful Tips and Useful Info:</p> <ul> <li>Make cut lines as thin as it will let you, try 0.001 width stroke lines with no fill</li> <li>Raster lines get weird, you can experiment with width, but double check how it looks in RetinaEngrave, at a certain thickness it decides its not one line, but instead gives you the outline of the space your line took up.</li> <li>If you plan on doing a raster engrave then vector cut, make your cut lines a lighter color than your raster lines, something like a light blue or green is visible, and will be easier to cut out later.</li> <li>Text....is a pain.  No matter what I do, I can't seem to get RetinaEngrave to understand solid letters.  Fortunately for my project, it was a small enough gap that the end result looks like a single engrave line</li> <li>The saddest truth about using Illustrator is that the safest, most correct way to get it into RetinaEngrave is to print your .ai file without scale adjustment to a PDF.  Don't ask, I don't know, but it makes my head hurt too.</li> <li>Once you have a .pdf, you can open it and use the PDF reader to print via the Full Spectrum driver</li> <li>MAKE SURE TO SET A PAPER SIZE BIG ENOUGH.  I believe its Foxit Reader on the computer hooked up to the laser cutter, and it will happily ignore the contents of the document when the checkbox 'Choose paper source by PDF page size' is checked.  Instead uncheck that and go to the Properties of the Full Spectrum driver and find something larger than the measurement of your design, for instance to get my 12 x 12 design into RetinaEngrave I had to select C size sheet</li> <li>Printing this way will import the design into RetinaEngrave</li> </ul>","tags":["software"]},{"location":"tags/","title":"Tags","text":"<p>Tags used across RTFM are listed here:</p>"},{"location":"tags/#stub","title":"STUB","text":"<ul> <li>Software Articles</li> <li>Grizzly G0513ANV Band Saw</li> <li>Craftsman Professional 3/4 hp Drill Press</li> <li>8\" Jointer</li> <li>owon SmartDS8102V 100MHz 2GSa/s Digital Osilloscope</li> <li>Vizatek PSM6003LK2 60V DC Power Supply</li> <li>\"Big Boi\" Laser Cutter</li> <li>iehk A4 DTG Printer A4 Garment Printer</li> <li>Canon iPF6400SE Large Format Printer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#crafts","title":"crafts","text":"<ul> <li>Consew 230 Industrial Sewing Machine</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#cutting","title":"cutting","text":"<ul> <li>Silhoutte Cameo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#editors","title":"editors","text":"<ul> <li>Manual of Style</li> <li>Articles</li> <li>Equipment Articles</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#electronics","title":"electronics","text":"<ul> <li>owon SmartDS8102V 100MHz 2GSa/s Digital Osilloscope</li> <li>Vizatek PSM6003LK2 60V DC Power Supply</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#equipment","title":"equipment","text":"<ul> <li>Equipment Articles</li> <li>Equipment Template</li> <li>Consew 230 Industrial Sewing Machine</li> <li>Silhoutte Cameo</li> <li>Grizzly G0513ANV Band Saw</li> <li>Craftsman Professional 3/4 hp Drill Press</li> <li>8\" Jointer</li> <li>ShopBot PRSstandard CNC 96-48</li> <li>Powermatic 14\" Surface Planer</li> <li>Delta Cabinet Table Saw</li> <li>Grizzle PRO T33300 Track Saw</li> <li>owon SmartDS8102V 100MHz 2GSa/s Digital Osilloscope</li> <li>Vizatek PSM6003LK2 60V DC Power Supply</li> <li>\"Big Boi\" Laser Cutter</li> <li>\"First Child\" Laser Cutter</li> <li>\"New Kid\" Laser Cutter</li> <li>iehk A4 DTG Printer A4 Garment Printer</li> <li>GBC Ultima 65 27\" Large Format Laminator</li> <li>SHARP MX-3070v Multi-Function Printer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#fabric","title":"fabric","text":"<ul> <li>iehk A4 DTG Printer A4 Garment Printer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#formatting","title":"formatting","text":"<ul> <li>Formatting</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#ink","title":"ink","text":"<ul> <li>iehk A4 DTG Printer A4 Garment Printer</li> <li>Canon iPF6400SE Large Format Printer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#lamination","title":"lamination","text":"<ul> <li>GBC Ultima 65 27\" Large Format Laminator</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#laser-cutter","title":"laser cutter","text":"<ul> <li>\"Big Boi\" Laser Cutter</li> <li>\"First Child\" Laser Cutter</li> <li>\"New Kid\" Laser Cutter</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#paper","title":"paper","text":"<ul> <li>Canon iPF6400SE Large Format Printer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#posters","title":"posters","text":"<ul> <li>Canon iPF6400SE Large Format Printer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#power","title":"power","text":"<ul> <li>Vizatek PSM6003LK2 60V DC Power Supply</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#print","title":"print","text":"<ul> <li>iehk A4 DTG Printer A4 Garment Printer</li> <li>Canon iPF6400SE Large Format Printer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#print-and-office","title":"print and office","text":"<ul> <li>iehk A4 DTG Printer A4 Garment Printer</li> <li>GBC Ultima 65 27\" Large Format Laminator</li> <li>Canon iPF6400SE Large Format Printer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#rtfm","title":"rtfm","text":"<ul> <li>Manual of Style</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#sewing","title":"sewing","text":"<ul> <li>Consew 230 Industrial Sewing Machine</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#sewing-machine","title":"sewing machine","text":"<ul> <li>Consew 230 Industrial Sewing Machine</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#signal","title":"signal","text":"<ul> <li>owon SmartDS8102V 100MHz 2GSa/s Digital Osilloscope</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#software","title":"software","text":"<ul> <li>Software Articles</li> <li>Retina Engrave</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#style","title":"style","text":"<ul> <li>Manual of Style</li> <li>Articles</li> <li>Equipment Articles</li> <li>Formatting</li> <li>Software Articles</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#template","title":"template","text":"<ul> <li>Equipment Template</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#vinyl","title":"vinyl","text":"<ul> <li>Silhoutte Cameo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#woodworking","title":"woodworking","text":"<ul> <li>ShopBot PRSstandard CNC 96-48</li> <li>Powermatic 14\" Surface Planer</li> <li>Delta Cabinet Table Saw</li> <li>Grizzle PRO T33300 Track Saw</li> </ul>"}]}
