It is a space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, learning. Our motto is: \"Let's make stuff awesome!\" The group tends to be focused on electronics. However, many members do metal working, programming, wood working, crafting, and a variety of other things. Synshop provides a fertile environment and community that is passionate about learning, helping others, and growing the community of hackers/makers/tinkerers/geeks in Las Vegas. We also like to meet people from other hackerspaces, and have seen people visit SYN Shop from hackerspaces world wide. See SYN Shop Vision Where is the SYN shop? \uf0c1 5967 Harrison Dr, Las Vegas, NV 89120 What is the best time to visit SYN Shop? \uf0c1 Note - we're operating at reduced capacity - see our COVID19 page . When not operating at reduced capacity, our hours normally are: Monday: 6pm - 10pm DIY Robot Domination Tuesday: 6pm - 10pm Craft night, Community night Wednesday: 6pm - 10pm Thursday 6pm - 10pm Friday 6pm - 10pm Saturday: 3pm - 10pm Sunday: Closed Mondays and Tuesdays are themed after interest groups. If you come to work, your project does not have to match the theme. However these nights tend to attract members of the community that are interested in that theme. DIY Robot Domination attracts robotics enthusiasts. Craft Night attracts \"Team Low Tech\" and all others who are interested in a variety of general crafts. Think of a knitting circle where one person knits, one person builds models, and another sews a quilt. You do not need to be a member to come spend time and acclimate yourself. You do need to be a member to use our equipment. How do I become a paying member? \uf0c1 Go to our membership page and follow the 5 steps. What are the dues? \uf0c1 Being part of the community is free as is joining our our Discord Server . It's also free to come down to the shop and acclimate yourself when ever we're open. Meet our people, and join in the conversation! Using the equipment requires you to be a paying member. The dues are set at $50 per month. For this price, you gain access to all of our equipment during open hours. If you eventually become a Vetted Member in good standing, you will have access to the shop and its equipment 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. How to I get involved? \uf0c1 The best way to get involved with the group is to show up when we're open nights, join the Discord Server , and just participate in things. People at SYN Shop have all been very open to hearing what other people are working on, answering questions, and offering help. It's a great group of folks, and is looking to only get better in the future. What are the rules? \uf0c1 We are a community, which means there are more people here than just you. If you get value from being with us, please give back with time or a donation. To expand on our most basic rule, \"Don\u2019t be a jerk\" we have come up with the following rules (PDF) for members to follow while at SYN Shop. Further, SYN Shop has our own bylaws that start out: \"SYN Shop is dedicated to the goal of educating and enabling the greater Las Vegas community in the creative use of developing and established fabrication technologies, and to undertake and pursue any lawful activity associated with such technologies.\" We regularly review the bylaws and the current copy is available for all to read (PDF) .

It is a space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, learning. Our motto is: \"Let's make stuff awesome!'' History \uf0c1 SYN Shop was started back in 2008, when a bunch of DIY enthusiasts decided that instead of hiding in our garages, workshops and offices, we should instead come together and start a community around the things we are passionate about. Who We Are \uf0c1 We are hackers, makers, artists, innovators, inventors, people of knowledge, and people who want to learn. We are people who take things apart to see how they work. We design the new because it has not been done before, and we reinvent what has already been done for the challenge of doing it ourselves. We're here to discover the unknown. To teach others, and to put our mark on the world by helping others. We're here to form a community of people who come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things. What We Are Not \uf0c1 We may be hackers, but we are hackers in the same sense that Steve Wozniak or Dean Kamen are hackers. We're not here to break into your ex's cell phone/computer/automobile, etc.. We're not the people who attack and deface web sites, steal people's credit card information, or even identities. In fact many of us work in industries which protect against such people. How To Get Involved \uf0c1 If you are in the Las Vegas valley area and are interested in the hackerspace idea, sign up to one of our Mailing Lists , or show up to a SYN Shop event . The Name \uf0c1 What does the name \"SYN Shop\" mean, and why do we call ourselves by that name? When computers need to talk to one another over the network, SYN is the first packet sent out during the TCP three-way handshake. Since Hacker Spaces are about communication, we felt this was a good way of symbolizing what we do. You can also say that Syn, could stand for \"Synergy\". Synergy is defined as two or more things functioning together to produce a result not independently obtainable, which also fits well with the Hacker Space ideals. And lastly since we live in Las Vegas, SYN is a fun play on words and the city's often heard nick name \"Sin City.\"","title":"SYN Shop Vision"},{"location":"users/SYN%20Shop%20Vision/#syn-shop-vision","text":"SYN Shop is a hackerspace located in Las Vegas, Nevada.

What exactly are you offering? We're offering a small virtual machine (VM) with 512MB RAM, 1 CPU, 10GB of disk and 1Mbit of network. These will all be Ubuntu 16.04 instance. Why only Ubuntu? The server is running the LXD hypervisor which uses the Linux Kernel for all guest VMs. This means you can only run OSes that use the same kernel, like Ubuntu. Wait, I can have a FREE server with my membership!? Yes! However, there are three main limitations: These are for personal use only. If you want to do something commercial check out the other VM providers - they start at about $5/mo . This is not a production environment. We'll try to keep the VMs up 100% of the time, but we don't have fancy hardware like battery back up and there'll likely be outages here and there. Otherwise, these are full VMs where you have root and can install any software that will fit on 1 CPU/512GB RAM and 10GB of disk. Hack away, hacker!! These machines are only accessible via SSH. So, for example, you can not run a web server that is accessible on the internet (though it would be accessible at the shop!) So if I can\u2019t run a publicly accessible service, like a web server, what can I do with it? So, so many things! The main thing we hope you\u2019ll do is learn about linux and the command line. However, you could set up a web server which is accessible only at the shop. You could have nagios server for monitoring your other services. The world is your (internet not accessible) oyster!! I don't like the command line - do you have a web UI where I can easily do X (where X is install something etc.)? No! These are bare VMs that are ripe for the taking. You need to either A) be versed in the command line to know what your doing or B) have a hankering to learn. If you ask, we'll be happy to teach you how to set up a server! I'm really concerned about privacy - will my secrets be safe on my server? Yes and no! Yes - we'll ensure the VM can only be access via an SSH key. We'll keep the host OS up to date. Likely no one on the internet will gain access to your server. No - the shop is where the host server is which is porous venue. Theft is a possibility. Currently the drives of the server are un-encrypted and a motivated attacker could access your data. Caveat Emptor. Or, I guess, Caveat \"Emptor\" as it's free ;) Ok, I'm in - how do I sign up? Email mrjones@synshop.org and supply me with your username you use on synshop.org to pay your membership and your public SSH key. That all sounds great, but I have more questions/don't know what an SSH key is/need help - what do I do? Still email mrjones@synshop.org! We'll figure a time when we can help you in person.

Wait, I can have a FREE server with my membership!? Yes! However, there are three main limitations: These are for personal use only. If you want to do something commercial check out the other VM providers - they start at about $5/mo . This is not a production environment. We'll try to keep the VMs up 100% of the time, but we don't have fancy hardware like battery back up and there'll likely be outages here and there. Otherwise, these are full VMs where you have root and can install any software that will fit on 1 CPU/512GB RAM and 10GB of disk. Hack away, hacker!! These machines are only accessible via SSH. So, for example, you can not run a web server that is accessible on the internet (though it would be accessible at the shop!) So if I can\u2019t run a publicly accessible service, like a web server, what can I do with it? So, so many things! The main thing we hope you\u2019ll do is learn about linux and the command line. However, you could set up a web server which is accessible only at the shop. You could have nagios server for monitoring your other services. The world is your (internet not accessible) oyster!! I don't like the command line - do you have a web UI where I can easily do X (where X is install something etc.)? No! These are bare VMs that are ripe for the taking. You need to either A) be versed in the command line to know what your doing or B) have a hankering to learn. If you ask, we'll be happy to teach you how to set up a server! I'm really concerned about privacy - will my secrets be safe on my server? Yes and no! Yes - we'll ensure the VM can only be access via an SSH key. We'll keep the host OS up to date. Likely no one on the internet will gain access to your server. No - the shop is where the host server is which is porous venue. Theft is a possibility. Currently the drives of the server are un-encrypted and a motivated attacker could access your data. Caveat Emptor. Or, I guess, Caveat \"Emptor\" as it's free ;) Ok, I'm in - how do I sign up? Email mrjones@synshop.org and supply me with your username you use on synshop.org to pay your membership and your public SSH key. That all sounds great, but I have more questions/don't know what an SSH key is/need help - what do I do? Still email mrjones@synshop.org! We'll figure a time when we can help you in person. We welcome everyone to this service and want to help folks get up and running. Watch out though - you'll be learning stuff ;)","title":"Member Boxes FAQ"},{"location":"users/Equipment/Big%20Boi%20Laser%20Cutter/","text":"\"Big Boi\" Laser Cutter \uf0c1 The shop's largest laser cutter, thus it is called \"Big Boi\" 150 Watt Pro LF Series 48\" x 36\" CO2 Uses Retina Engrave See also \"First Child\" and \"First Child\" laser cutters","title":"\"Big Boi\"  Laser Cutter"},{"location":"users/Equipment/Big%20Boi%20Laser%20Cutter/#big-boi-laser-cutter","text":"The shop's largest laser cutter, thus it is called \"Big Boi\" 150 Watt Pro LF Series 48\" x 36\" CO2 Uses Retina Engrave See also \"First Child\" and \"First Child\" laser cutters","title":"\"Big Boi\"  Laser Cutter"},{"location":"users/Equipment/Consew%20230%20Industrial%20Sewing%20Machine/","text":"Consew 230 Industrial Sewing Machine \uf0c1 This is the green industrial table mounted sewing machine located in the craft room.

Some things to keep in mind: Double check your design between the program you started in, and RetinaEngrave. The print driver is not smart, and cuts off sections if it resets to the standard letter size, can scale things when you need exact sizes, and most annoyingly renders solid lines into multiple ones at seemingly random.

Instead, engrave and cut on side A, go steal a dental pick from the electronics bin, flip your object over in place, then engrave side B Blue painters tape or masking tape is your friend. Even if you don't need it to cover your surface to prevent burn, after you've engraved side B, sticking a strip of tap across your cutout parts and the board/plastic will let you pick up most, if not all, the pieces at once off the bed.

Helpful Tips and Useful Info: Make cut lines as thin as it will let you, try 0.001 width stroke lines with no fill Raster lines get weird, you can experiment with width, but double check how it looks in RetinaEngrave, at a certain thickness it decides its not one line, but instead gives you the outline of the space your line took up.

A few weeks prior a mutual friend had an idea for an art project that involved lit pingpong balls cycling through a fountain.

Note: All resistor values were determined by experimentation using parts we already had lying around the shop. Circuit There are 3 identical 555 timer circuits, one for each axis of the accelerometer, wired up as astable oscillators. The outputs from the accelerometer axis are hooked directly into the control voltage. As the accelerometer is moved the output voltage varies between ~.5 and ~2.5 volts representing -1 to +1g on each axis. This causes the duty cycle of the 555 timers to vary between ~40% and ~95%. Since the 555 is being used as a sink for the LEDs, higher duty cycle = dimmer led. Everything is run off 2 3v coin cell batteries wired in parallel. 5v power cannot be applied to this circuit without blowing the accelerometer. Prototype \uf0c1 Like most hackers we generally prototype on a solderless breadboard. This presented a bit of a problem for this build as we did not have any of the major components in a breadboard-compatible DIP version. Krux quickly whipped up breakout boards for the surface mount 555 and 556, but the tiny accelerometer gave us a bit more trouble. Not wanting to etch a breakout board, we flipped it over and krux soldered leads directly onto the pads, creating a dead bug breakout. The dead bug was then mounted on a piece of perfboard and headers were added to make a breadboard compatible package. Most of the rest of the afternoon was filled with cursing as we tried to figure out how to make the 555 do what we were trying to do. The result was this: The smaller breadboard holds just the accelerometer so we could test it without having to move the whole circuit around. Although the small board is an microcontroller dev board, only the solderless breadboard piece is being used. This advancement only came after an hour of frustration caused by wires and other parts flying off the main board as we tried to test. And here is a still of it in action. Board \uf0c1 Once the prototype was working we went about designing a board that would fit inside a pingpong ball. We knew this would be a daunting task as it would need to be a double sided board with components on both sides in order to fit inside. We were concerned that we would not be able to etch the board ourselves, specifically the tiny, closely spaced pads needed by the tiny accelerometer. We ended up printing transparencies and using the photoresist etch method to etch one side of the board, drill alignment holes, and then expose and etch the other side. Krux said it was --the best board he had ever made-- a pretty good board despite the microscopic flaw in one of the traces which caused a significant amount of cursing and debugging. A note on soldering the accelerometer. Our original plan was to use solder paste and reflow the accelerometer side of the board using an electric skillet. However, due to not being able to obtain decent solder paste locally krux instead placed a bit of solder on each pad, then used a hot air rework station to reflow just the one area. This worked like a charm and you can see the results in the picture above. The board mounted inside the pingpong ball. It finally works in the 11th hour, less than 24 hrs before the contest ends. Special thanks to PG who stayed up way past her bedtime to cheer us on and had the idea of putting tape onto the batteries where they overlapped the vias. She was also the control rod to prevent us from collapsing in a fit of rage and cursing. We had a variety of issues building the actual board. Since the board is hand etched we had to wire the vias. This created issues as our battery holders were right over the top of a few of them. Liberally applied tape kept everything from shorting out. We also had a tiny gap in one of the traces which was causing one of the 555 timers to not get the correct amount of power. This took a lot of time to track down. Both of these can be avoided if we have the boards made for us by a PCB manufacturer. Though this build had a lot of tricky stuff, most of it was related to cramming it into a tiny space. This is a really fun circuit to play with and can be easily built on a breadboard using dip components and a breakout board for the accelerometer.

Note: All resistor values were determined by experimentation using parts we already had lying around the shop. Circuit There are 3 identical 555 timer circuits, one for each axis of the accelerometer, wired up as astable oscillators. The outputs from the accelerometer axis are hooked directly into the control voltage. As the accelerometer is moved the output voltage varies between ~.5 and ~2.5 volts representing -1 to +1g on each axis. This causes the duty cycle of the 555 timers to vary between ~40% and ~95%. Since the 555 is being used as a sink for the LEDs, higher duty cycle = dimmer led. Everything is run off 2 3v coin cell batteries wired in parallel. 5v power cannot be applied to this circuit without blowing the accelerometer.","title":"Parts List"},{"location":"users/Projects/555%20Contest%20-%20Gravity%20Detecting%2C%20Color%20Swirling%20Pingpong%20Balls/#prototype","text":"Like most hackers we generally prototype on a solderless breadboard. This presented a bit of a problem for this build as we did not have any of the major components in a breadboard-compatible DIP version. Krux quickly whipped up breakout boards for the surface mount 555 and 556, but the tiny accelerometer gave us a bit more trouble. Not wanting to etch a breakout board, we flipped it over and krux soldered leads directly onto the pads, creating a dead bug breakout. The dead bug was then mounted on a piece of perfboard and headers were added to make a breadboard compatible package. Most of the rest of the afternoon was filled with cursing as we tried to figure out how to make the 555 do what we were trying to do. The result was this: The smaller breadboard holds just the accelerometer so we could test it without having to move the whole circuit around. Although the small board is an microcontroller dev board, only the solderless breadboard piece is being used. This advancement only came after an hour of frustration caused by wires and other parts flying off the main board as we tried to test. And here is a still of it in action.","title":"Prototype"},{"location":"users/Projects/555%20Contest%20-%20Gravity%20Detecting%2C%20Color%20Swirling%20Pingpong%20Balls/#board","text":"Once the prototype was working we went about designing a board that would fit inside a pingpong ball. We knew this would be a daunting task as it would need to be a double sided board with components on both sides in order to fit inside. We were concerned that we would not be able to etch the board ourselves, specifically the tiny, closely spaced pads needed by the tiny accelerometer. We ended up printing transparencies and using the photoresist etch method to etch one side of the board, drill alignment holes, and then expose and etch the other side. Krux said it was --the best board he had ever made-- a pretty good board despite the microscopic flaw in one of the traces which caused a significant amount of cursing and debugging. A note on soldering the accelerometer. Our original plan was to use solder paste and reflow the accelerometer side of the board using an electric skillet. However, due to not being able to obtain decent solder paste locally krux instead placed a bit of solder on each pad, then used a hot air rework station to reflow just the one area. This worked like a charm and you can see the results in the picture above. The board mounted inside the pingpong ball. It finally works in the 11th hour, less than 24 hrs before the contest ends. Special thanks to PG who stayed up way past her bedtime to cheer us on and had the idea of putting tape onto the batteries where they overlapped the vias. She was also the control rod to prevent us from collapsing in a fit of rage and cursing. We had a variety of issues building the actual board. Since the board is hand etched we had to wire the vias. This created issues as our battery holders were right over the top of a few of them. Liberally applied tape kept everything from shorting out. We also had a tiny gap in one of the traces which was causing one of the 555 timers to not get the correct amount of power. This took a lot of time to track down. Both of these can be avoided if we have the boards made for us by a PCB manufacturer. Though this build had a lot of tricky stuff, most of it was related to cramming it into a tiny space. This is a really fun circuit to play with and can be easily built on a breadboard using dip components and a breakout board for the accelerometer.","title":"Board"},{"location":"users/Projects/555%20Contest%20-%20Gravity%20Detecting%2C%20Color%20Swirling%20Pingpong%20Balls/#downloads","text":"Schematic (Eagle) | Full schematic for use with eagle Schematic (PDF) | Same schematic, but in pdf form Board (Eagle) | Board layout file for eagle Board Top (PDF) | Board top in pdf format.
