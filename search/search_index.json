It is a space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, learning. Our motto is: \"Let's make stuff awesome!\" The group tends to be focused on electronics. However, many members do metal working, programming, wood working, crafting, and a variety of other things. Synshop provides a fertile environment and community that is passionate about learning, helping others, and growing the community of hackers/makers/tinkerers/geeks in Las Vegas. We also like to meet people from other hackerspaces, and have seen people visit SYN Shop from hackerspaces world wide. See SYN Shop Vision Where is the SYN shop? \uf0c1 5967 Harrison Dr, Las Vegas, NV 89120 What is the best time to visit SYN Shop? \uf0c1 Note - we're operating at reduced capacity - see our COVID19 page . When not operating at reduced capacity, our hours normally are: Monday: 6pm - 10pm DIY Robot Domination Tuesday: 6pm - 10pm Craft night, Community night Wednesday: 6pm - 10pm Thursday 6pm - 10pm Friday 6pm - 10pm Saturday: 3pm - 10pm Sunday: Closed Mondays and Tuesdays are themed after interest groups. If you come to work, your project does not have to match the theme. However these nights tend to attract members of the community that are interested in that theme. DIY Robot Domination attracts robotics enthusiasts. Craft Night attracts \"Team Low Tech\" and all others who are interested in a variety of general crafts. Think of a knitting circle where one person knits, one person builds models, and another sews a quilt. You do not need to be a member to come spend time and acclimate yourself. You do need to be a member to use our equipment. How do I become a paying member? \uf0c1 Go to our membership page and follow the 5 steps. What are the dues? \uf0c1 Being part of the community is free as is joining our our Discord Server . It's also free to come down to the shop and acclimate yourself when ever we're open. Meet our people, and join in the conversation! Using the equipment requires you to be a paying member. The dues are set at $60 per month. For this price, you gain access to all of our equipment during open hours. If you eventually become a Vetted Member in good standing, you will have access to the shop and its equipment 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. How to I get involved? \uf0c1 The best way to get involved with the group is to show up when we're open nights, join the Discord Server , and just participate in things. People at SYN Shop have all been very open to hearing what other people are working on, answering questions, and offering help. It's a great group of folks, and is looking to only get better in the future. What are the rules? \uf0c1 We are a community, which means there are more people here than just you. If you get value from being with us, please give back with time or a donation. To expand on our most basic rule, \"Don\u2019t be a jerk\" we have come up with the following rules (PDF) for members to follow while at SYN Shop. Further, SYN Shop has our own bylaws that start out: \"SYN Shop is dedicated to the goal of educating and enabling the greater Las Vegas community in the creative use of developing and established fabrication technologies, and to undertake and pursue any lawful activity associated with such technologies.\" We regularly review the bylaws and the current copy is available for all to read (PDF) .

It is a space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, learning. Our motto is: \"Let's make stuff awesome!'' History \uf0c1 SYN Shop was started back in 2008, when a bunch of DIY enthusiasts decided that instead of hiding in our garages, workshops and offices, we should instead come together and start a community around the things we are passionate about. Who We Are \uf0c1 We are hackers, makers, artists, innovators, inventors, people of knowledge, and people who want to learn. We are people who take things apart to see how they work. We design the new because it has not been done before, and we reinvent what has already been done for the challenge of doing it ourselves. We're here to discover the unknown. To teach others, and to put our mark on the world by helping others. We're here to form a community of people who come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things. What We Are Not \uf0c1 We may be hackers, but we are hackers in the same sense that Steve Wozniak or Dean Kamen are hackers. We're not here to break into your ex's cell phone/computer/automobile, etc.. We're not the people who attack and deface web sites, steal people's credit card information, or even identities. In fact many of us work in industries which protect against such people. How To Get Involved \uf0c1 If you are in the Las Vegas valley area and are interested in the hackerspace idea, sign up to one of our Mailing Lists , or show up to a SYN Shop event . The Name \uf0c1 What does the name \"SYN Shop\" mean, and why do we call ourselves by that name? When computers need to talk to one another over the network, SYN is the first packet sent out during the TCP three-way handshake. Since Hacker Spaces are about communication, we felt this was a good way of symbolizing what we do. You can also say that Syn, could stand for \"Synergy\". Synergy is defined as two or more things functioning together to produce a result not independently obtainable, which also fits well with the Hacker Space ideals. And lastly since we live in Las Vegas, SYN is a fun play on words and the city's often heard nick name \"Sin City.\"","title":"SYN Shop Vision"},{"location":"users/SYN Shop Vision/#syn-shop-vision","text":"SYN Shop is a hackerspace located in Las Vegas, Nevada.

It is driven by the RetinaEngrave (version 2) Windows software which is available as a free download from Full Spectrum Engineering. Designs can be started in the software, but often it is better to design images in a graphics program and use the Full Spectrum Engineering Printer Driver to print directly into RetinaEngrave. To do this, start RetinaEngrave first, and then open your image file to print. RetinaEngrave \uf0c1 As the sign on the laser cutter says, it has no brain, please use yours. RetinaEngrave is very simplistic and often will not do things as you expect, or feel are basic. It is also terrible about telling you what is wrong with your files, and many times searching online will not produce useable answers. Some things to keep in mind: Double check your design between the program you started in, and RetinaEngrave. The print driver is not smart, and cuts off sections if it resets to the standard letter size, can scale things when you need exact sizes, and most annoyingly renders solid lines into multiple ones at seemingly random. The fist two are easy to fix, but the last will take a lot of trial and error to make lines thinner before printing to RetinaEngrave, or cleaning it up inside RE. It's good to follow the Laser Cutter checklist, but make note of your settings before you start, and be prepared to fix them all right before you start(press G). A particular annoyance, the dropdown between Vector, Raster, or Raster then Vector. It likes to reset that after doing a perimeter trace. Be prepared for experimentation on power vs speed. Two passes at higher speed and lower power may cut better, take less time, and have less burn than one at lower speed and higher power. Double Sided Laser Engraving \uf0c1 Remember RetinaEngrave's lack of brain. The internet will tell you you can make a design on separate layers of a graphics file, and print them separately into RE and they will line up. The internet lies for this software and this laser cutter. You need two wholly separate files The only way to make them line up is to put a big black registration square in the upper left, above your design. A 6mm one will be recognized Cut, then flip. Trying to line up a board to engrave side A then engrave and cut side B is almost impossible to get level. Instead, engrave and cut on side A, go steal a dental pick from the electronics bin, flip your object over in place, then engrave side B Blue painters tape or masking tape is your friend.

Working with Adobe Illustrator and RetinaEngrave \uf0c1 Adobe Illustrator is a fairly common vector art tool, but its not available at SynShop.

Helpful Tips and Useful Info: Make cut lines as thin as it will let you, try 0.001 width stroke lines with no fill Raster lines get weird, you can experiment with width, but double check how it looks in RetinaEngrave, at a certain thickness it decides its not one line, but instead gives you the outline of the space your line took up.

It is driven by the RetinaEngrave (version 2) Windows software which is available as a free download from Full Spectrum Engineering. Designs can be started in the software, but often it is better to design images in a graphics program and use the Full Spectrum Engineering Printer Driver to print directly into RetinaEngrave. To do this, start RetinaEngrave first, and then open your image file to print.","title":"Freestanding Laser Cutter"},{"location":"users/Equipment/Freestanding Laser Cutter/#retinaengrave","text":"As the sign on the laser cutter says, it has no brain, please use yours. RetinaEngrave is very simplistic and often will not do things as you expect, or feel are basic. It is also terrible about telling you what is wrong with your files, and many times searching online will not produce useable answers. Some things to keep in mind: Double check your design between the program you started in, and RetinaEngrave. The print driver is not smart, and cuts off sections if it resets to the standard letter size, can scale things when you need exact sizes, and most annoyingly renders solid lines into multiple ones at seemingly random. The fist two are easy to fix, but the last will take a lot of trial and error to make lines thinner before printing to RetinaEngrave, or cleaning it up inside RE. It's good to follow the Laser Cutter checklist, but make note of your settings before you start, and be prepared to fix them all right before you start(press G). A particular annoyance, the dropdown between Vector, Raster, or Raster then Vector. It likes to reset that after doing a perimeter trace. Be prepared for experimentation on power vs speed. Two passes at higher speed and lower power may cut better, take less time, and have less burn than one at lower speed and higher power.","title":"RetinaEngrave"},{"location":"users/Equipment/Freestanding Laser Cutter/#double-sided-laser-engraving","text":"Remember RetinaEngrave's lack of brain. The internet will tell you you can make a design on separate layers of a graphics file, and print them separately into RE and they will line up. The internet lies for this software and this laser cutter. You need two wholly separate files The only way to make them line up is to put a big black registration square in the upper left, above your design. A 6mm one will be recognized Cut, then flip. Trying to line up a board to engrave side A then engrave and cut side B is almost impossible to get level. Instead, engrave and cut on side A, go steal a dental pick from the electronics bin, flip your object over in place, then engrave side B Blue painters tape or masking tape is your friend.

A few weeks prior a mutual friend had an idea for an art project that involved lit pingpong balls cycling through a fountain. We decided to take a part of this idea and run with it: lit pingpong balls. What are these good for you ask? They make great cat toys, they entertain small children, and I really want to build about 50 of them and dump them into the Bellagio Fountains here in Vegas. Our end result was a circuit that uses 3 independent 555 timer circuits to drive a pair of RGB LEDs. A 3-axis accelerometer hooked to the control pins of each 555 vary the intensity of each color as the orientation of the device changes. The whole device is powered by a 3v coin cell battery and if the appropriate packages are used the whole thing will fit inside a pingpong ball. Here are a couple of videos of both the prototype and the real thing in action to prove that the circuit does in fact work! Just to show you it is all self contained.

Note: All resistor values were determined by experimentation using parts we already had lying around the shop. Circuit There are 3 identical 555 timer circuits, one for each axis of the accelerometer, wired up as astable oscillators. The outputs from the accelerometer axis are hooked directly into the control voltage. As the accelerometer is moved the output voltage varies between ~.5 and ~2.5 volts representing -1 to +1g on each axis. This causes the duty cycle of the 555 timers to vary between ~40% and ~95%. Since the 555 is being used as a sink for the LEDs, higher duty cycle = dimmer led. Everything is run off 2 3v coin cell batteries wired in parallel. 5v power cannot be applied to this circuit without blowing the accelerometer. Prototype \uf0c1 Like most hackers we generally prototype on a solderless breadboard. This presented a bit of a problem for this build as we did not have any of the major components in a breadboard-compatible DIP version. Krux quickly whipped up breakout boards for the surface mount 555 and 556, but the tiny accelerometer gave us a bit more trouble. Not wanting to etch a breakout board, we flipped it over and krux soldered leads directly onto the pads, creating a dead bug breakout. The dead bug was then mounted on a piece of perfboard and headers were added to make a breadboard compatible package. Most of the rest of the afternoon was filled with cursing as we tried to figure out how to make the 555 do what we were trying to do. The result was this: The smaller breadboard holds just the accelerometer so we could test it without having to move the whole circuit around. Although the small board is an microcontroller dev board, only the solderless breadboard piece is being used. This advancement only came after an hour of frustration caused by wires and other parts flying off the main board as we tried to test. And here is a still of it in action. Board \uf0c1 Once the prototype was working we went about designing a board that would fit inside a pingpong ball. We knew this would be a daunting task as it would need to be a double sided board with components on both sides in order to fit inside. We were concerned that we would not be able to etch the board ourselves, specifically the tiny, closely spaced pads needed by the tiny accelerometer. We ended up printing transparencies and using the photoresist etch method to etch one side of the board, drill alignment holes, and then expose and etch the other side. Krux said it was --the best board he had ever made-- a pretty good board despite the microscopic flaw in one of the traces which caused a significant amount of cursing and debugging. A note on soldering the accelerometer. Our original plan was to use solder paste and reflow the accelerometer side of the board using an electric skillet. However, due to not being able to obtain decent solder paste locally krux instead placed a bit of solder on each pad, then used a hot air rework station to reflow just the one area. This worked like a charm and you can see the results in the picture above. The board mounted inside the pingpong ball. It finally works in the 11th hour, less than 24 hrs before the contest ends. Special thanks to PG who stayed up way past her bedtime to cheer us on and had the idea of putting tape onto the batteries where they overlapped the vias. She was also the control rod to prevent us from collapsing in a fit of rage and cursing. We had a variety of issues building the actual board. Since the board is hand etched we had to wire the vias. This created issues as our battery holders were right over the top of a few of them. Liberally applied tape kept everything from shorting out. We also had a tiny gap in one of the traces which was causing one of the 555 timers to not get the correct amount of power. This took a lot of time to track down. Both of these can be avoided if we have the boards made for us by a PCB manufacturer. Though this build had a lot of tricky stuff, most of it was related to cramming it into a tiny space. This is a really fun circuit to play with and can be easily built on a breadboard using dip components and a breakout board for the accelerometer.

History \uf0c1 This originally was at the old shop in the display window when we were at 117 N 4th St, Las Vegas. It had a manual timer that you could set for how long it should stay on. When it first turned on it would show green and when there was 30 min left on the timer, it would turn yellow: After the move to the location to 1075 American Pacific, at some point it broke. Current status \uf0c1 As of Feb 2020, it has been revived with the power or IoT! It now has an ESP32 chip that powers a screen, web server controller and automated timer. You may have guessed where the UI came from ;) . If you're in the shop, you can control the lights at time-circuit.synshop.org . If you're not in the shop, you can see an image of the light status in the upper right of any page on our web site . Further, if you just can't get enough traffic light, we have a live image as well as live status JSON , both updated every minute. Note - If the traffic light crashes, you know, because IoT, then the last cached JSON file will be shown. The traffic light image and JSON may be stale, thus wrong!!

We are finalizing the purchase of a new building that will be wholly owned by us! Here's a FAQ to fill folks in. The move is already underway, so here\u2019s what you can expect in these coming months: \uf0c1 Where is the new location? \uf0c1 Our new location is at 5967 Harrison Dr., Las Vegas, NV . With this change in location, we are much closer to central Vegas, hopefully making it more accessible to our local members. The area is just outside of the McCarran Marketplace plaza which offers a number of different restaurants, as well as being between a 5min drive to Lowes or Home Depot. Is the American Pacific shop still open? \uf0c1 At this time, the move has already started and equipment has already been dismantled and is in the process of moving. All equipment has to be removed from the American Pacific location by the end of this month (November 2020). It is likely that no equipment is operational at this time. What does the move mean for my membership? \uf0c1 For all paying members, we have sent out e-mail notices about the shop move status and how that will specifically impact your own membership. Please make sure that your account on synshop.org is updated with the correct email information to receive these important notices when we send them. In brief- You are welcome to pause your membership during this time by either: updating your payment account at SYN Shop.org, or by emailing us to request a pause. We understand that during these times many members can not afford to keep their memberships active, but if you are able to continue supporting our space as we prepare to finalize these new expenses; we encourage you to consider continuing to support us by keeping an active membership, or to consider a direct tax-deductible donation at https://synshop.org/donate (please fill your email if you would like a donation receipt). Please be sure to email us if you have any questions regarding your membership. How soon can we begin to use the Harrison location? \uf0c1 The move-in is already underway, but as with any move we will need time to settle in and set up. We hope to set up our more flexible equipment (such as 3D printers, crafts, electronics, etc) as soon as possible, but before the space is fully opened, we are expecting to do some construction. This includes demolishing some walls to open up the work area, and create enough entryways for some of our larger equipment (like metalworking, and laser cutting). Because of the construction in conjunction with the delays due to holiday hours, we are not certain what the official timeframe will be so we encourage you to keep active in our discord community for the latest information. Where can I find updates? \uf0c1 Join our Discord group! If you are not already a member of our Discord chat group . Here, we have a number of channels dedicated to different topics including #shop-move. This is where you can find progress on our move, as well as up-to-date discussions and how to help. How can I help? \uf0c1 We have to be completely moved by the end of this month, so if you are able to offer hands, vehicles, and even just some cardboard boxes, we greatly appreciate it! Message us in the #shop-move channel of our discord group when/how you are willing to help, so that everyone can schedule the best times to meet and move. Covid Safety \uf0c1 To anyone visiting or helping our transition to our new location, please keep in mind that Covid-19 protocols are still in place. Masks must be worn at all times in our locations, and distance must be kept where possible. Thank you all for bearing with us and continuing to support us during these unprecedented times.
